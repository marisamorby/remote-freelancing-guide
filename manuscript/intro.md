Well hello there! My name is Marisa Morby and I'm using this book to help you learn how to become a freelancer. That's a pretty standard book these days, I know, but this is different because I'm not some 20 year-old talking at you about freelancing in web development, after starting to code when I was 8.

In fact, I started doing this with _no_ technical experience other than how to work a computer. I'm talking zero knowledge here. And when I first started freelancing, it was after 5 years in corporate America as an HR Manager. 

That means my network of freelancers consisted of one person.

And, just because I can be masochistic, I thought, fuck it, I'm going to change careers, too. I loved the psychology and human interaction of HR, but I _hated_ all the rules and policies and regulations. 

So I decided to dedicate my time to what I'd always wanted to do, and what I've been doing most of my life, which was writing.

Which led me to a brand new problem: what was I gonna write about?

As much as I'd love to be the American J.K. Rowling, I know that type of genius rarely bubbles up on command, and my plot lines leave a lot to be desired.

So instead I focused my writing on something that everybody wants: making more money.

I became a copywriter.

That meant I needed to know about technology, marketing, psychology, and selling. I spent quite a bit on books.

And as I learned more, I started trying new things, getting new clients, refining my work, and expanding my focus, which is where I'm at now.

A UX Consultant and Copywriter.

I did all of this while traveling around the world (like I said, masochist), and only worked with clients remotely.

So, all that being said, I'm writing this guide so that you can bypass some of the mistakes I made when I started out.


## What this guide is and isn't
  This guide is designed to help you understand how to get your first client, complete the project, and get referrals for more work, all while working remotely.

  This isn't a guide to help you decide what service/product to offer, or a resource for business advice or legal advice. There are many people that are much better at these things than me, but I did include a **list of resources** at the back to help you out. 

Happy reading!
